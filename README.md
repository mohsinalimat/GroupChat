# GroupChat
This is a Group Chat Application using Google Firebase as backend.
A user can register him/herself into this application using a mail id. Once the user register him/herself, a mail will be triggered
to his/her mailbox which has to be verified by clicking on the verification link in order to get completely registered for this application.
Once the user gets into the application, an alert message will come which will notify the user to create atleast one group to 
continue chatting, else the user can get into any registered group if he/she know the group's credential. Yes, each group is having
a password to get into it.Once the user gets into any group, he/she can view all the messages of every other users who are also
part of that group. Initialy I kept the messaging into two parts 1) Text Message & 2) Picture Messaging.

I will keep this repo upadted with new enhancements & fetaures once I complete it.

To complete the Chat Screen I have used "JSQMessagesViewcontroller" (https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQMessagesViewController)
Apart from that I have couple of 3rd party libraries like:

1. JJMaterialTextField (https://github.com/juanjoguevara/JJMaterialTextField)
2. KRProgressHUD (https://github.com/krimpedance/KRProgressHUD)
3. OpinionzAlertView (https://github.com/Opinionz/OpinionzAlertView)
4. PopupDialog (https://github.com/Orderella/PopupDialog)
5. SwiftMessages (https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages)

and most importantly Firebase 4.0 pod


I have tried to use the MVVM pattern in this project as I am totally new into this. Please feel free to contact me over the mail
(sohamb.1390@gmail.com) if you see any mistakes. I am always happy to learn from you. :)
